# 🌐 AI Trade Toolkit

An AI-powered trade decision support system designed to help users navigate modern international trade risks such as tariffs, currency fluctuations, and protectionism.

## 📌 Motivation

Recent years have shown a global shift toward protectionist trade policies, including unpredictable tariff decisions and fluctuating exchange rates — particularly influenced by figures such as former U.S. President Donald Trump.  
This project was built to provide a data-driven way to help users simulate, forecast, and adapt to such shifts in trade environments.

## 🚀 Features

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 💱 Exchange Rate Converter | Convert product prices using real-time exchange rates |
| 📈 Exchange Forecast | Forecast USD to other currency trends using time-series models |
| 🔁 Scenario Analysis | Evaluate how price changes with different tariff and FX rate scenarios |
| 🤖 Trade Chatbot | Ask questions and get automated, context-aware responses |
| 🚨 Risk Dashboard | Get notified if your trade route involves excessive tariffs or volatile exchange rates |
